## Background and GIS methods
We need to make a number of charts and maps for the Michigamme Highlands that:

* compare past and present acres per ecosystem
* identify degraded lands
* summarize condtions of existing cover, height and type
* etc.

To get started Randy did a "Combine" in ArcGIS 10.4 of:

* LANDFIRE ReMap (version 200) Existing Vegetation Cover, Height and Type (evc, evh and evt)
* LANDFIRE 2012 (version 130) Biophysical Settings
* Michigamme Highlands raster (converted from polygon supplied by Emily)

This 90k+ row combine was exported to Excel for initial cleaning and is in the "michCBN_WU.xlsx" file.  For example EVT_GP_N was cleaned, renaming anything "Agricultural*" to simply "Agricultural".
